# Negotiatus Lite demo app

This Ruby on Rails app demonstrates my competence with Rails, by reimplementing a small part of the website [Negotiatus](https://www.negotiatus.com/). Negotiatus is a web app for business procurement on which customers can enter products and request discounts to be negotiated for them. I implement a bare-bones version of the user system, creation of products, adding products to a cart, and viewing your inventory of previously-ordered products.

You can [play with my live app](https://rory-negotiatus-lite.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.

The initial version of the app was based on a template from `rails_app_composer`. The template provided support for users with Devise, a default page layout, and some default styles. I implemented everything else.
